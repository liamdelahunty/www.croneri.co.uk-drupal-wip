Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is an integral part of being a successful tax, audit and accounting professional.

Much of what you do every day will count as CPD. It's not just about attending courses or watching webinars but can include a wide range of activities, such as listening to podcasts, coaching, problem solving, reading articles and learning from your colleagues. For an activity to count as CPD, you will need to show how it is relevant to your role and has helped you to meet your learning needs.

Maintaining your CPD strengthens your professional credibility. It provides you with the skills and knowledge you need to do your role more effectively and prepares you for the challenges ahead. CPD also demonstrates to your fellow members and the wider public that you are invested in remaining proficient and at the forefront of the profession.

Our tool will enable you to capture evidence of your learning and research on Croner-i platforms and Accountancy Daily. The tool will also allow you to capture additional work which may count towards your CPD.

We recommend you keep a separate tool for each CPD year - ICAEW's CPD year runs from 1 November to 31 October however if you keep a different CPD year there is no need to change your recording period.
