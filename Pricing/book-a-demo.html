<!--


Ben to create the 4 forms with the existing 6 fields (Pricing request). Button = Request Pricing

Liam to create the 4 tiles which will bring up the right pricing request form:

Tax, Audit & Accounting
HR
Safety & Environment
Care
 

If someone lands on the page, if Munchkin code recognises them and the person does not complete a form, it triggers an email to the person’s known email account and asks if they saw something they were interested in – and redirects them to the same pricing form and asks if they’d prefer to talk to someone.

 

Form to queue to say:

Pricing Request: Tax, Audit & Accounting
Pricing Request: HR
Pricing Request: Safety & Environment
Pricing Request: Care
 

Lead queue
