Practical tips to help you prepare for major changes to UK GAAP

Synopsis -

Last year, changes were finalised to refresh accounting under UK GAAP as part of the 2024 Periodic Review. The changes are largely effective from 1 January 2026 and have wide reaching implications including the highly publicised changes to revenue and lease accounting. But some of the changes in other areas will have very significant impacts for many companies including smalls and micros.

This webinar will provide you with key information as well as practical tips to ensure a smooth transitionary period in preparation for January 2026, minimising any business disruption.

KLPS -

In this webinar we’ll provide you with practical steps to ensure you are ready to meet the challenge of accounting under the new requirements. We’ll cover revenue and leases, and also emphasise the important changes in other areas which have grabbed less of the limelight but which will have significant impacts for many companies whatever their size.

This webinar will enable you to:

Understand what the periodic review entails, the interaction with changes to company size limits and the impact on financial reports;

Identify the key changes to leases and revenue;

Understand the additional changes arising from the periodic review which will affect recognition, measurement and disclosures in the financial statements;

Understand the impact and changes for small companies under FRS 102 s1A and micro entities under FRS 105; and

Prepare calmly for the changes throughout 2025, avoiding unnecessary stress at the year end.
