Input Tax - what it is and when it can be claimed

Input tax- what it is and when can it be claimed  (1).jpg

June 26, 2024 14:00

Sarah Kay Input Tax Accountex talk.

When VAT returns are completed the question of whether or not VAT incurred on a particular expense can be recovered frequently arises.
When this happens the first point to resolve is whether not the VAT is input tax in the first place. The first part of this presentation will explore how input tax is defined for VAT purposes as, if VAT is not input tax, it cannot be claimed. In the second part of the presentation we will address the conditions which input tax must meet in order for it to be claimed.
