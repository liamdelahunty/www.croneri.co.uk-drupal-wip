The next 50 years of Health and Safety


In the 50th year of the Health & Safety at Work etc Act 1974, we can credit the Act to contributing to the reduction of non-fatal injuries by 80% and fatalities from 651 in 1974 to 138 in 2023/24. In its golden anniversary we have much to celebrate! But we must also recognise there is much more still to do.

We are on the cusp of another transformative era, which will see unprecedented synergy between human and machine intelligence. Our workplaces are changing at a rapid pace and at the same time, the working population is getting older and more sedentary, bringing new challenges around workplace health and wellbeing.

What skills do you need to manage risk effectively, build knowledge and influence change in our evolving world?
How do we, as the health and safety community, prepare for these changes?
